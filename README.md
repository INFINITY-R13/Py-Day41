# Movie Ranking Project

This project showcases a simple application for listing the top 3 movies, implemented in three different ways: as a static HTML webpage, a Python console application, and a Python GUI application using tkinter. It demonstrates the evolution from basic web markup to interactive Python applications and graphical user interfaces.

## Versions Included

### 1. HTML Webpage (`index.html`)

A static webpage built with standard HTML tags to structure and display the movie list.

**Features:**
- Headings using `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`
- Descriptions using `<p>`
- Thematic breaks using `<hr>`

**How to Run:**
- Locate the `index.html` file.
- Double-click the file, or right-click and select “Open with” your preferred web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).

### 2. Python Console Application (`main.py`)

A simple script that prints the movie ranking list directly to the terminal.

**Features:**
- Displays output using the `print()` function
- Formatting achieved with newline characters (`\n`)

**How to Run:**
- Ensure Python is installed on your computer.
- Open terminal/command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
- Run the following command:
  ```bash
  python main.py
  ```

### 3. Python GUI Application (`movie_gui.py`)

A desktop application built with Python’s tkinter library for a graphical interface.

**Features:**
- Standalone window
- Label widgets for styled text display
- Separator widget for layout aesthetics

**How to Run:**
- Ensure Python is installed on your computer.
- Open terminal/command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
- Run the following command:
  ```bash
  python movie_gui.py
  ```
- A window will appear displaying the list of movies.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- Python 3
- Tkinter (Python's standard GUI library)
