Movie Ranking Project
This project showcases a simple application for listing top movies, implemented in three different ways: as a static HTML webpage, a Python console application, and a Python GUI application using tkinter.

Project Overview
The core purpose of this project is to display a curated list of top 3 movies. It started as a basic HTML exercise and evolved into interactive Python applications, demonstrating the transition from web markup to command-line and graphical user interfaces.

Versions
This repository contains three versions of the movie ranking application.

1. HTML Webpage (index.html)
A static webpage built with fundamental HTML tags to structure and display the movie list.

Features:

Uses <h1>, <h2>, <h3> for headings.

Uses <p> for descriptions.

Uses <hr> for a thematic break.

2. Python Console Application (main.py)
A simple script that prints the movie ranking list directly to the terminal.

Features:

Uses the print() function for all output.

Uses newline characters (\n) for spacing.

3. Python GUI Application (movie_gui.py)
A desktop application with a graphical user interface created using Python's built-in tkinter library.

Features:

Creates a standalone window.

Uses Label widgets to display text with custom fonts and styling.

Includes a Separator widget for visual structure.

How to Run
